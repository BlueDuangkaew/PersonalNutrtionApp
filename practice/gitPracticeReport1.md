Instructions:
	I just want you and your teammates to consult and to list things that you learned from the lab exercise, especially things that surprised you.
Team A (Peach):
I wouldn't say I am new to Git. I have used some of Git's functionalities before, such as Push, Pull, and Commit. This lab, however, has introduced me to the advanced level of Git, which includes merging, restoring, and resolving conflicts. I have realized that sometimes the best approach is to create different branches for each team member to work on their code, allowing them to modify the code while keeping the main code intact. This way, we can ensure that the main code is not polluted. If anything, I have also learned that we should always save the code before we commit since my VS Code editor didn't automatically save the code. This is the most crucial lesson I have learned because, God forbid, I have spent more than 40 minutes trying to figure out what went wrong, while the culprit was just the "saving" command.
Team B (Blue):

1. Before you edit the code that you work with the team, you should not forget to pull the up-to-date repository.

2. If you want to revert your code or file, you should know the serial number of each version you want to go back to. You can check for it by using `git log`.

3. Every time you edit any files, the status will show that the file is modified. If you are satisfied with the change, you need to add the file every time before you commit.

4. There are 3 main states: modified, staged, and committed.
   - Modified = the file is changed and has not been committed yet.
   - Staged = marking the modified file in its current version.
   - Committed = the data is already in the local database.

5. If you want to push the local data to GitHub, you need to use the command 'git push'.
