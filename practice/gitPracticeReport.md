## Team A (Palm):
It was my first time using Git. I was introduced to the very basic things like initializing repositories and creating commits to more advanced things like branching and resolving conflicts. It helps with structuring how you work, share code, and manage projects efficiently. Also make the chaotic process of code collaboration organized. The thing that surprised me the most was Git doesn’t require an internet connection to work, you can make commits and perform many things offline. Another thing was to commit before sharing, normally I would just commit and if I made a mistake, I would just delete and recommit. Git doesn’t immediately share the changes with others. You need to commit them first. This provides a level of control over what gets shared and what doesn’t.

## Team B (Pokpong):

What confused me initially was how to resolve conflicts, since there was no guide or suggestions on how to fix it at all. It turns out it was just a matter of using a text editor to incorporate the differences the way we want.

One thing that I didn’t expect was when git automatically merged the side branch to the main branch when I pulled the side branch while on the main branch. In hindsight it seems to make sense since pull, in my understanding, will not remove or replace the files locally.

Some other things I noticed is that the command “git branch -d” only removes locally. In order to remove the branch in the remote repository I had to use the command “git push -d <remote repository link>  <branch name>”.
